## About This Fork

This repository contains our fork of the Basilisk C codebase ([basilisk.fr](http://basilisk.fr)). We maintain this fork to track and document comphy-lab related bugs and issues. This is a development fork that will be frequently synced with the main Basilisk repository.

## About Basilisk C

Basilisk C is a powerful open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) framework that provides:

- A complete environment for solving partial differential equations on adaptive Cartesian meshes
- Built-in support for multiphase flows, surface tension, and complex geometries
- High-performance parallel computing capabilities
- Advanced visualization tools with interactive 3D display
- Memory profiling and debugging capabilities
- Python integration through SWIG
