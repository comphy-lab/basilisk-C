## About This Fork

This repository contains our fork of the Basilisk C codebase (basilisk.fr). We maintain this fork to track and document comphy-lab related bugs and issues. This is a development fork that will be frequently synced with the main Basilisk repository.

## About Basilisk C

Basilisk C is a powerful open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) framework that provides:

- A complete environment for solving partial differential equations on adaptive Cartesian meshes
- Built-in support for multiphase flows, surface tension, and complex geometries
- High-performance parallel computing capabilities
- Advanced visualization tools with interactive 3D display
- Memory profiling and debugging capabilities
- Python integration through SWIG

### Key Features

- **Adaptive Mesh Refinement**: Efficient handling of complex geometries and flow features
- **Multiphase Flows**: Built-in support for interface tracking and surface tension
- **Parallel Computing**: Scalable performance for large-scale simulations
- **Interactive Visualization**: Real-time 3D visualization using WebGL
- **Memory Management**: Built-in memory tracing and profiling tools
- **Extensible Architecture**: Modular design allowing easy addition of new physical models

### Getting Started

For installation and usage instructions, please refer to the [installation guide](src/INSTALL) and [tutorial](Tutorial) in the main Basilisk repository.
