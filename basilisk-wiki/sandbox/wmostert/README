My name is Wouter Mostert, I am an associate professor at Oxford in the Department of Engineering Science. Previously, I studied at the University of Queensland in Australia (under Vincent Wheatley) where I got my BEng (Mechanical & Aerospace, 2012) and PhD (2015) degrees; I did postdoctoral research at Caltech (with Dale Pullin) and Princeton (with Luc Deike), and spent some time as an assistant professor at the Missouri University of Science and Technology.

My interests are in fluid mechanics, namely in air-sea interaction concerning mass, momentum and energy primarily due to wave breaking, along with the associated dynamics of bubbles and droplets, which play a large role in these kinds of problems. Waves in shallow water environments are also of interest, especially the dynamics and energetics of breaking solitary waves, and more broadly around the effects of ocean wave systems on sediment and pollutant transport, along with better understanding wave loadings on civil infrastructure. 

Other interests include problems in compressible gases and continuum plasma models, especially dynamics and geometrical stability of material interfaces and of shock waves in such systems, and potential analogues in water wave systems.

### Some problems
*[A shoaling and breaking solitary wave](shallow.c)

*[A shoaling and breaking solitary wave in the presence of wind](windshoaling.c) (due especially to hard work by Kentaro Hanson - see also [Falk Feddersen's sandbox](http://basilisk.fr/sandbox/ffeddersen/) )

*[Deformation of a bubble in a turbulent environment](turbulent_bubble.c)

*[Breaking Stokes wave](http://basilisk.fr/sandbox/popinet/wave.c) (from [Stephane Popinet's sandbox](http://basilisk.fr/sandbox/popinet))

*[Droplet bag-breakup in a cross-flow](http://basilisk.fr/sandbox/kaitaotang/dw14l11.c) (from [Kaitao Tang's sandbox](http://basilisk.fr/sandbox/kaitaotang) and, crucially, using the manifold death algorithm from [Leonardo Chirco's sandbox](http://basilisk.fr/sandbox/lchirco/))

*[Transverse collision of two liquid rims](http://basilisk.fr/sandbox/kaitaotang/docoll3d.c) (from [Kaitao Tang's sandbox](http://basilisk.fr/sandbox/kaitaotang))
