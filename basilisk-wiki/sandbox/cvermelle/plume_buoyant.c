/**
# The buoyant plume

The aim of this code was to get to use the Navier-Stokes solver.
Lots of it derives from [Antoon van Hooft](../Antoonvh/README)'s work.

The buoyancy is due to the gradient of concentration of a chemical, equations are the same than with the traditional Boussinesq approach.

The PÃ©clet number in the heat equation is now $\Pi$, an equivalent for solute flows.
