#My Sandbox
The codes presented here include the research topics of liquid solidification and ice melting. I am using the hybrid level-set/embeded boundary method (LSEB) developed by [/sandbox/alimare](). The very first code here considers the solidification process with density change. Please note that the code presented here is under testing.

### Validation cases

* [Solidification with density change](test_cases/Navisolid.c)
