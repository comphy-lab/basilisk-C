# Hello World
Hi, I'm Francesco, and I'm actually working active colloids.

![And yes, I use VI. Comic by[xkcd](xkcd.com)](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/real_programmers.png)

For this reason, I'm re-adapting [Arthur Ghigo](http://basilisk.fr/sandbox/ghigo/src/) implementation of moving embedded boundaries.

Updated on june 2025

## Forces/Torques on a moving embedded boundary
- A variation of classic [couette](/src/test/couette.c), but computing torques [couette_torque](test/couette_torque.c)

# Quasi-steady Stokes flows, in 2D

- Single sedimenting cylinder between flat plates, fully hydrodynamic coupling, after [Dvinky & Popel 1987](cylinder_between_plates/sedimentation_driver_moving.c)

- Bio-mimetic active colloid, using the [tHree method](microswimmer_tHree_forces/single_swimmer_base_case.c). Single swimmer.

- Multiple microswimmers with the [tHree method](microswimmer_tHree_forces/plumes.c).
