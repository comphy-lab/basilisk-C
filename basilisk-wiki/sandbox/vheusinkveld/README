# Welcome to my sandbox
This page will provide an overview of the work I have done with Basilisk. Currently I am doing my master thesis at the Delft University of Technology at atmospheric sciences. Here I am researching possible mitigation techniques to combat cold night frost events in the lower part of the atmosphere (+-20m). I am supervised in part by [Antoon](http://basilisk.fr/sandbox/Antoonvh/README). 

My current full project can be found on [Github](https://github.com/VHeusinkveld/thesis_code/tree/master/basilisk/cases/krab), I find this to specific to be posted here, but if you are interested you can check it out.

## Cases ase used in '[Towards a physics-based understanding of fruit frost protection using wind machines](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2019.107868)'
