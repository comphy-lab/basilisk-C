# Introduction
The supplied header files fully support the implementation of the contact angle boundary condition for liquid/gas interfaces on embedded boundaries in Basilisk (October 2023 release).

Further details regarding the algorithmâ€™s implementation can be found in [Huang et al., 2025](#HUANG2025113975).
