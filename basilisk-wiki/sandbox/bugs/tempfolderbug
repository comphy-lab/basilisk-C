# Temporary folder is not removed  
When compiling a `.c` file that includes a header file like so, 

~~~literatec
...
#include "../folder/header.h"
...
~~~

A `folder` is created outside the temporary `.qcc` folder and it will not be removed. 

## how to reproduce  
~~~bash
$ cd $BASLISK/examples/
$ qcc -Wall -O2 -autolink breaking.c -L$BASILISK/gl \
            -lglutils -lfb_osmesa -lGLU -lOSMesa -lm
$ cd test    
$ ls
stokes.h
~~~
The last command reveals that a temporary folder had been created that was not removed.
