/**
# Threads may get stuck

The following example illustrates a scenerio where not all MPI treads
try to set (automatic) boundary conditions. It may wait forever or
crashes occur when other threads continue to set boundary conditions
in other contexts.

As soon as you "branch" execution depending on process number, i.e. here

~~~c
if (pid() == 0)
  do_something();
~~~

you need to be sure that "do_something();" is completely independent from what is happening in other processes (otherwise this thread will get stuck forever waiting for other processes).

This is not specific to Basilisk.</div>
