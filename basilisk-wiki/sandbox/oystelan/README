## Useful Functions
[waveprobes.h](waveprobes.h) This function can be used to extract time-series of surface elevation from a two-phase flow simulation

[output_vtu_foreach.h](output_vtu_foreach.h) dumps .vtu files (unstructured grid) which is supported by paraview

[adapt_wavelet_leave_interface.h](adapt_wavelet_leave_interface.h) Modified version of adapt_wavelet.h which forces maxlevel refinement in and around cells where the volume fraction is between 0 and 1.

## Examples

[Simple waveflume](waveflume/simple_waveflume.c) Shows how to create a stable implemention of a simple wave maker in 2D
