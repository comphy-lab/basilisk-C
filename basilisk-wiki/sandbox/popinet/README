I am Stéphane Popinet, the creator
of [Gerris](http://gerris.dalembert.upmc.fr) and [Basilisk](http://basilisk.fr). Since 2013 I have been
a ''directeur de recherche'' at Centre National de la Recherche
Scientifique ([CNRS](http://www.cnrs.fr/index.php)) based at Institut
Jean le Rond d'Alembert ([∂’Alembert](http://www.dalembert.upmc.fr))
of [Sorbonne Université](http://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en), Paris,
France. From 2001 to 2013 I was a research scientist at the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric research ([NIWA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Water_and_Atmospheric_Research)) based in Wellington, New Zealand, which I joined after completing my PhD in 2000 at [Université Pierre et Marie Curie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_and_Marie_Curie_University), Paris, France. I am both a French and New Zealand citizen.

My research interests reflect my double training and career in fluid mechanics and environmental sciences: multiphase flows, oceanic and atmospheric modelling, granular materials, waves, stratified flows, tsunamis etc.

I am particularly interested in developing numerical methods for partial differential equations (PDEs), both as a tool to explore the physics of complex flows using numerical experiments, and as a way to understand the structure and properties of PDES: a kind of *experimental mathematics*.

Having participated in oceanographic campaigns in the southern ocean (and also in Antarctica) ([Smith et al, 2010](#smith2010)) and having designed field experiments ([Popinet et al, 2004](#popinet2004)) and instrumentation ([Stevens et al, 2005](#stevens2005)) I also have a direct experience of experimental methods.

For a list of publications see below. See also [papers written

The method handles three-dimensional 6 degree-of-freedom motion of immersed solids of any number and of any shape under the influence of flow. We use it here to study the hydrodynamic interactions (between solid-wall and between soids) in a constant shear flow at low Reynolds number. The study calculates the influence from the solid- wall distance, solid-solid distance and ellipsoid geometrical characteristics. Distinct patterns emerge and the discussion focusses on improving our current understanding on solid migration due hydrodynamic interaction. "
