Hello, welcome to my sandbox. I am a joint PhD student at Sorbonne Universit√© (France) and Northwestern Polytechnical University (China). The topic of my PhD thesis is the numerical simulation of multiphase flows with phase change. The codes for some of my work are provided here. Feel free to contact me if you have any problems or if you have something to discuss with me. Email: tian.long@dalembert.upmc.fr

## EBIT for phase change flows
The Edge-based Interface-Tracking (EBIT) / Semushin method is a novel Front-Tracking method. I have extended it to simulate multiphase flows with phase change. The developed codes are given here. The codes of EBIT for mulitphase flows without phase change are copied from [jieyun's sandbox](http://basilisk.fr/sandbox/jieyun/README). The numerical tests can be found on the following pages:

* [Stefan problem](http://basilisk.fr/sandbox/tianlong/test/stefanproblem.c)
