# Estuary of the river Guadalquivir

The river Guadalquivir is an old river with a lot of history. Despite
its low depth the river has been always navigable. In fact, it was
used by the vikings to atack Sevilla in the IX century.  Today, the
river is still navigable up to Sevilla where a port is in use. Ships
with large drafts must ride the tide to sail up to the port of
Sevilla. 

![The Estuary of the Guadalquivir](estuary.jpg)

The river discharges in the Atlantic sea. The Do√±ana
National Park is located on the right riverbank. The village of
Sanlucar de Barrameda is on the left bank and is famous for its
wines.

# Simulation 

The simulation of the estuary is performed using an explicit scheme for
the Saint-Venant shallow water equations with adaptation.  That means to
use the most general model [hydro.c](/src/layered/hydro.h) assuming a
single layer and that the vertical momentum equation reduces to the
hydrostatic relationship. These assumptions are the default one. So
nothing has to be set in addition. Details of the layered model can be
found in [Popinet, 2020](/Bibliography#popinet2020). */

![Bathymetry](guadalquivir/zb.png)

The course of the river is very well described because of the high
number of points in the database at that location. Not the same
happens with some dry parts. The bathymetry also shows that the low
curse of the Guadalquivir goes through a marshland.

An inflow enters through the right. The inflow depends on time. Over a
constant flow rate $Qo$ = 150 $m^3/s$ a flood having the form of a
gaussian bell of height Qp = 2000 $m^3/s$ is set. The peak of flood
enters the domain with a delay of 500 minutes after the first peak of
the tide. If the riverbed is not well distinguished from the
riverbank, the inflow could spread along the right boundary as it trys
to compute a water elevation $\eta$ compatible with the inflow. To
avoid this unwanted mechanism we force the inflow to enter through the
region for which *river* is equal to 1. That is, through the narrow
gap going from $y_{low}$ = 4087935 up to $y_{up}$ = 4088357. */
