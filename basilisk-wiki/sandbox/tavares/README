# My Sandbox

Welcome to my sandbox. My topic of research is the development of numerical tools for wetting and phase change problems in multiphase flows.
I am using a coupled VOF/embedded boundary method to model two-phase flows on arbitrary solid surfaces.\\
I am also working on a hybrid level-set/embedded boundary numerical method (LSEB) originally developed by [/sandbox/alimare](). The idea is to couple this method with the VOF method to deal with contact angle and triple line evolution in solidification problem. \\
Please note that this method is under testing.

# Hybrid VOF/embedded boudary method

## Code

### Contact angle on embedded boundary

* [contact-embed.h](contact-embed.h): modified version of [contact-embed.h](/sandbox/popinet/contact/contact-embed.h).

### Navier boundary condidition on embed

* [embed-navier.h](embed-navier.h): modified version of [embed.h](/src/embed.h).

## Validation test cases
Validation test cases can be found on the following pages:

* [sessile + embed contact angle](test_cases/sessile_embed.c).
* [slot case + contact angle](test_cases/slot_contact_embed.c).
* [droplet on embedded cylinder](test_cases/droplet-cylinder-embed.c)
* [sessile droplet under gravity + embed](test_cases/sessile-embed-gravity.c).
* [3D sessile + embed](test_cases/sessile_embed3D.c).
* [droplet impact on thin fiber](test_cases/impact-thin-fiber.c).
