This project aims to simulate bag mode break up present on secondary
atomization of liquid droplets.

# Problem description

During secondary atomization, drops are deformed by the sorrounding air stream.
If gas Weber number is high enough, they eventually are decomposed in smaller
droplets. The whole procedure is vastly described in literature
([Opfer, 2014](/src/references.bib#opfer2014),
[Jain, 2015](/src/references.bib#jain 2015)).

Simulations conducted here are 2D, axisymmetric and finally, full 3D.

## Plane 2D cases
First case, which requires less resources, is the one
based on [Zaleski, 1995](/src/references.bib#zaleski1995).

Then, some cases using real physical problems from [Opfer, 2014](/src/references.bib#opfer2014)
are set.


## Axisymmetric cases
A more realistic setup can be achieve without increasing resources
using an axisymmetric domain. First, a reference case
is solved to be compared with [Han & Trygvasson, 1999](/src/references.bib#han1999).

Again, this setup is tested with the correct physical parameters from [Opfer, 2014](/src/references.bib#opfer2014).

## 3D cases
The last case is meant to be compared with the data in [Opfer, 2014](/src/references.bib#opfer2014).

# Simulation features

## Local Adaptive Mesh Refinement

In order to avoid refinement away from the droplet, we use the following adapt event:

~~~literatec

event vorticity (i++,first) {
  foreach()
    omegaZ[] = (u.y[1] - u.y[-1] - u.x[0,1] + u.x[0,-1])/(2.*Delta);
}

...

event adapt (i++) {
  scalar MAXLEVEL;
  foreach(){
    if(cellDistanceToDrop[] < predefRadius)
      MAXLEVEL[] = 12;
    else
      MAXLEVEL[] = 10;
  }
  adapt_wavelet ({f,omegaZ,p,u}, (double[]){1e-3,1e-3,1e-2,1e-1,1e-1,1e-1}, MAXLEVEL, 6);
}
~~~

In this example, near drop zones can get to level 12, and the rest of the domain up to 10.
Note that the region of max refinement could be moving (and could also expand depending on predefRadius definition)
This alternative [adapt_wavelet_limited.h](sandbox/pairetti/bag_mode/adapt_wavelet_limited.h) function has been created from
the one available in the [tree-common.h](src/grid/tree-common.h) file.

Also, vorticity z-component is employed as a field to performed refinement.
