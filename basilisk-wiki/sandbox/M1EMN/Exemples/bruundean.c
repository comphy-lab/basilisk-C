# Resolution of the shape of a Beach by Bruun 64 & Dean 91 model

It is believed that the shore cross profile is a power law $Z=Ax^n$ where $x$ is distance offshore ($x<100m$), $0<Z<10m$ is water depth, 
averaged measurements give $n=0.66$ (in fact $0.03<x<1.4$ see Pilkey 94, we did himself a mistake in the equation). Bruun obtained that from fits of measurements.

To establish this,  Dean supposes that there is a uniform wave energy dissipation constant per unit volume $D_*$, and that within the breaking zone the flux of energy is steady and dissipated at a rate $D_*$:
$$D_*= \frac{1}{h}\frac{d}{dx}(E C_g)$$
where $E$ and $C_g$ are the energy density and group velocity.
The waves come from the right to the left, we suppose that the mean sea level defines level 0, 
as $E \propto Z^2$ and $C_g \propto \sqrt{Z}$, hence 
the equation  without dimension is :
$$ \frac{d}{dx}(Z^{5/2})= Z $$
we solve it with a relaxation as:
$$ \frac{\partial}{\partial x}Z  + \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(Z^{5/2})= Z $$
the method is similar to  [http://basilisk.fr/sandbox/M1EMN/BASIC/advecte1.c]() which explains the notions of advection, testing the flux, coded with Basilisk (see the end, maybe $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}Z^2 $ is better).

Starting by a slope and a flat bottom, we wil compute evolution to the steady power law 
~~~gnuplot 
set xlabel "x"
set ylabel "depth"
set arrow from 3,-(3.*3./5)**(2./3) to 3,0
set label "depth -Z(x)" at  3.5,-1
set key left bottom
p[0:10][]  -0.25*(x<1? x:1) t'initial', -(3*x/5)**(2./3) t'expected' w l  linec 3 
~~~
 Note that here $Z$ is positive, in regular Shallow Water configuration we use $z_b$ which is $-Z$, as here $\eta=0$.

  DT = (L0/N)/16/4; 
  run();

##Run
Then compile and run:

~~~bash
qcc  -g -O2 -DTRASH=1 -Wall  bruundean.c -o bruundean ;./bruundean > out
~~~
##Results
The analytical solution solves the equilibrium flux/dissipation
$$dZ(x)^{m}/dx =  Z  $$
so that 
$Z=(\frac{(m-1)}{m} x)^{\frac{1}{m-1}}$
with m=5/3, so that we obtain
$Z(x)= (3 x/5)^{2/3}$
the Bruun's solution.

Note that there is obviously a problem of B.C. at the right:


~~~gnuplot
 set xlabel "x"
 set ylabel "-Z"
 set key left bottom
 p[:][-3.5:0]'out' u ($1):(-$2)t'num'w l,-(3*x/5)**(2./3) t'exact' w l linec 3 
~~~

which is  $-Z(x,t)$ plotted here for t=0 .5 1 1.5  2 ...


time evolution with splot:
~~~gnuplot
 set xlabel "x"
 set ylabel "t"
 set zlabel "Z"
 sp [:][:][0:5]'out' u 1:3:2 w l,(3*(x)/5)**(2./3) t'exact' w l    
~~~

## Exercise
  
Solve now with $\partial_t Z^2$ instead of $\partial_t Z$, to have an energy like equation in $Z^2$
  
$$ \frac{\partial}{\partial x}Z^2  + \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(Z^{5/2})= Z $$

which is as well, $m=5/2$
  
  $$ \frac{\partial}{\partial x}Z + \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(\frac{m}{2 (m-1)}Z^{m-1})= \frac{1}{2} $$
