# Evaporation of the mixture drop

We investigate the evaporation of a single droplet of a mixture in a still and
dry environment. In this example the solute diffuse very slowly and limits the
evaporation rate.

![Evaporating droplet with the vapor concentration
field](high_peclet_drop/video_solute.mp4)

We didn't put surface tension and we didn't make depend the equilibrium vapor
concentration on the curvature. Therefore, the interface is completely unstable
and the smallest wavelength (the grid size) appears. I didn't investigate
this instability, but we can understand it easily. The solvent, which diffuses
slowly, has to reach of the interface to evaporate. Where the interface is
closer to the core of the drop, the solvent concentration is higher, so the
evporation is quicker.

This not physical: a cell should be concentrated more quickly than its neighbor
just because its liquid fraction is smaller. To solve this problem we define a
function to compute a concentration at the interface which average the
concentration over a reconstructed cell, which have always the same volume (or
area in 2D). This reconstructed cell share its volume between the cell at the
