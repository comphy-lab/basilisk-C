# Karamea flood tutorial on basilisk

This page is a step-by-step description of how to setup, run and
visualise a flood simulation with basilisk. This is the basilisk
equivalent of [this tutorial on
Gerris](http://gerris.dalembert.upmc.fr/karamea_flood_tutorial.html).
We will simulate the lower reaches of the Karamea river, including
part of the sea on the western boundary.

## Prerequisites

For this tutorial, we need three input files :

* A Digital Terrain Model of the area:
 [topo.asc](http://gerris.dalembert.upmc.fr/karamea/topo.asc)

* A flow-rate file
 defining the evolution in time of the river flow at the eastern
 boundary: [flow.asc](http://gerris.dalembert.upmc.fr/karamea/flow.asc)

* A tide file defining the sea level at the western boundary:
 [tide.asc](http://gerris.dalembert.upmc.fr/karamea/tide.asc)

Download and put them in the same repository than your C file. You
need to convert the topo.asc file in a topography file that can be
read by basilisk. [The whole process is explained
here.](http://gerris.dalembert.upmc.fr/karamea_flood_tutorial.html#Creating_the_topography)
   
## Solver Setup

The following headers specify that we use the Saint-Venant
solver together with [(dynamic) terrain
reconstruction](/src/terrain.h). The "inflow" library is a collection of functions for imposing
boundary conditions and the "hydro" library specify how to compute flow. 
We will use [inputs](/src/input.h) only when
restarting a simulation from a snapshot.

of the gravity constant to $m.s^{-2}$, so unity of variables will be
meters for length and seconds for time. We fix the "dry" value at 1

## Bondaries conditions

On the right boundary, we impose an inflow equal to the hydrograph
data "flow.asc". In this file, the inflow is gaven in $m^3.s^{-1}$
(cumsec), so we have to fix a boundary condition as a total inflow
condition, which is not trivial. Thankfully, the function "discharge" do
this for us. This function takes as arguments the total inflow wanted,
the considered boundary and a scalar fixing the area where the inflow
occurs (the River[] scalar). "discharge" returns the water elevation
needed to impose the inflow.

By using the "discharge" function, you must fix a zero Neumann condition
on the velocity  :
*/

/**
Now we can fix the water elevation on the right border with a
Dirichlet condition. The water elevation will change in respect to the
time, so we must do this in an event. Note that the "hydrograph" function
reads ASCI datas and returns a linear interpolation in respect to the
time. We fix the second argument of the function "hydrograph" to 3600
in order to convert hours in seconds.

/**
 
## Compiling

We tell to the compiler to use the object kdt.o. This object is needed
to use the function "terrain". We also add the math header and
an optimisation option :

~~~bash 
./

~~~

## Running

Now we can run the simulation. 
   
~~~bash
./karamea.x

~~~
## Results


Check if the tidal condition was correctly treated :

~~~gnuplot
plot './check-exp.dat' u ($1/3600):2 w l
replot './check-exp.dat' u ($1/3600):3 w l
replot './tide.asc'
~~~

Check if the right inflow condition was correctly treated :

~~~gnuplot
plot './check-exp.dat' u ($1/3600):6 w l
replot './check-exp.dat' u ($1/3600):5 w l
replot './flow.asc'

~~~
