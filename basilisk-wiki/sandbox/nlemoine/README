I am a ''*maître de conférences*'' in hydrology at Sorbonne Université based at [Metis](http://www.metis.upmc.fr) lab, and currently on secondment at [Institut Agro Rennes-Angers](https://www.institut-agro-rennes-angers.fr) (AgroCampus Ouest) in Rennes. I am interested in flood modeling using Saint Venant equations, but also modeling of flow in porous medium and glacier ice flow. From a numerical point of view, I am mainly focusing on the limit cases of weakly inertial or zero-inertial flows (diffusive overland flow, Darcy flow, shallow ice flows, etc.).

## **Ice flow modeling**
### *Shallow Ice Approximation*
 
* [Halfar 1D similarity solution](ice/halfar1D.c), see [Halfar,1981](https://doi.org/10.1029/JC086iC11p11065)
* [Halfar 2D radial similarity solution](ice/halfar2D.c), see [Halfar,1983](https://doi.org/10.1029/JC088iC10p06043)

## **Shallow Water Equations**
### *Boundary conditions for river flow modeling*

* [Inflow routine for use with MPI without masks](SWE/inflow-tilt.h) (work in progress)
* [Topographic and friction source term with detrended bathymetry](SWE/manning-tilt.h): a procedure allowing to deal more easily with a "uniform flow" downstream boundary condition.

### *Diffusive wave approximation*

* [2D diffusive wave](SWE/diffwave/diffwave.c): zero-inertia approximation to the full Saint-Venant system

### *Stationary, periodic solutions*

* [MacDonald](SWE/MacDonald/subcritical.c)'s test problem #3

## **Darcy flow modeling**
### *Analytical Element Method*
* [AEM-based](AEM/envelope/envelope.c) computation of the *Basal Envelope Surface of Talwegs*

### *Numerical cases*
* [Hydrodynamic modeling of the Meuvaines coastal wetland](groundwater/Meuvaines/meuvaines.c)
