# Combat fruit frost, using Vortex rings

Hello, 

for my Bachelor thesis (Civil engineering) I investigated the opportunity to use vortex rings to protect fruit against freezing. The numerical models used in this research can be found below. 

The research consists of four parts where numerical models are used.:

1. Vortex ring generation with a cross flow

2. Vortex rings through a shearing atmosphere

3. Vortex rings through a stratified atmosphere

4. Fruit frost based example

Enjoy reading!
