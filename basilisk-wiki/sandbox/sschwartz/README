# Welcome!
My name is Spencer Schwartz, and this is my Basilisk sandbox. I am a Master's student at the Univeristy of South Carolina studying immersed boundary methods and flow blurring atomization. Below you will find code related to my projects and publications.

# Immersed Boundary Methods (IBM)

### Immersed Reconstructed Boundary Method (IRBM)

##### Source Code
* [README](IRBM/README.md)
* [ibm.h](IRBM/ibm.h)
* [ibm-utils.h](IRBM/ibm-utils.h) : contains helper functions for ibm.h

##### Test Cases

* [Flow over a 2D cylinder](IRBM/ibm-cylinder.c)
* [Flow over a 3D sphere](IRBM/ibm-sphere.c)
* [Flow over a 2D oscillating cylinder](IRBM/ibm-cylinder-osc.c)
