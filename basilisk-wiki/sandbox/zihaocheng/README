# My sandbox

## Overview
Hello fellow CFDers! Welcome to my sandbox!

I'm currently a PhD student in the research group of Prof. [Anthony Wachs](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~wachs/) at the University of British Columbia. My research pertains to the fully-resolved simulation of particle-laden flows using the Immersed Boundary-Lattice Boltzmann Method (IB-LBM). In this sandbox, I provide the source files which enable the implementation of IB-LBM based on Basilisk, and a series of test cases involving fluid-particle interactions in both 2D and 3D. For a detailed description of the numerical method and more quantitative analysis of the simulation results, please refer to [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002199912200732X).

## Methods
### Lattice Boltzmann Method
* [LBM.h](src/LBM.h): A standard implementation of the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) with a multiple relaxation time collision operator. To fit the octree-grid refinement framework, a finite-difference type streaming operator is adopted.

### Immersed Boundary method
* [ibm.h](src/ibm.h): Foundamentals of the Immersed Boundary Method, including the Lagrangian point-stencil structure, stencil update function, simulation restart function, meomry management and initialization subroutine.
* [lag_stencil.h](src/lag_stencil.h): Some classic and modified Dirac delta functions used in stencil operations.
* [lag_to_eul.h](src/lag_to_eul.h) and [eul_to_lag.h](src/eul_to_lag.h): Information exchange between the lagrangian points on immersed body surfaces and the Eulerian grid centers.

## Test cases
* [Simple Poiseuille flow](test_cases/Poiseuille.c):
* [2D wall-bounded flow past a cylinder](test_cases/Cylinder_bounded.c):
* [2D inline oscillating cylinder in a fluid at rest](test_cases/Oscillating_cylinder.c):
* [2D Neutrally bouyant cylinder in a planar Couette flow](test_cases/Neutrally_bouyant_Couette.c):
