# Greetings
Hello and
welcome to my sandbox !

This is where I will put all my programms, coded during my internship at [Institut ∂'Alembert](http://www.dalembert.upmc.fr) in 2023 which was supervised by
[Stéphane Popinet](http://www.basilisk.fr/sandbox/popinet/README) and
[Julie Deshayes](https://juliedeshayes.github.io/).
I also thank [Guillaume Michel](http://www.dalembert.upmc.fr/home/michel/) for his help during my time at ∂'Alembert.

* The first *real* code I made is called
[beach_topo](Beach_topo_basilisk/beach_topo.c),
and it is basically [beach.c](http://basilisk.fr/src/test/beach.c)
but with a custom bathymetry we can implement as we want.

* Then I tried using wave theory derived from the dispersion relation $\omega=\sqrt{gk\tanh(kH)}$
with the [waves1D](waves_1D/) example.
See the comparison of the Saint-Venant model (non dispersive) and the multilayer model (dispersive),
respectively in the [waves1D.c](waves_1D/waves1D.c) and [waves1D_SV.c](waves_1D/waves1D_SV.c) codes.

* My third test, called [beach_waves](Beach_waves/beach_waves.c) is the sum of the two first works : waves dispersion above a custom bathymetry.

* The [fourth work](http://basilisk.fr/sandbox/Gwendal_Leger/Port_waves/) corresponds to the most important work I've done during my internship:
a 2D simulation of waves in the port of Boulogne-sur-mer.

* Finally, I also studied the behaviour of different boundary conditions while propagating waves during a "long" run, in a setup similar to the one in [beach.c](http://basilisk.fr/src/test/beach.c). The comparison of the Dirichlet, radiation and "manual" radiation boundary conditions are presented with the code titled [Dirichlet_vs_Radiation](etude_dirichlet_radiation/Dirichlet_vs_Radiation.c).
