# Basilisk Documentation
I'm crafting this doc for the convience of anyone who is interested in how things go inside Basilisk and those may want to alter the solver.
Since there are obstacles in translating Tex into Markdown and uploading images, docs in this sandbox provide only basic introduction and associate reference.\
If you know Chinese, there is a draft in my [GitHub](https://github.com/Langford-H/BasiliskManual) which however contains a lot of mistakes and will no longer be updated.\

------------------------------------------

**See [here](https://github.com/Langford-H/Basilisk-Documentation) for a more detailed version written in tex.**
