# My Sandbox
Welcome to the README for my sandbox. This page serves as your gateway to exploring the exciting projects within [/sandbox/farsoiya/]. My aim is to offer you an informative overview of these endeavors, and I hope you discover something that captivates your interest. Feel free to use these codes without worrying about authorship, I just request you to cite the papers where I have introduced the numerical method.
