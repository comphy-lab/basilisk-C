# My Sandbox
Welcome to my sandbox.

In this space, I will share the topics I am investigating using the Basilisk framework.

## Collision rate in turbulent flows laden with droplets/bubbles
The study of droplet-laden turbulent flows requires different numerical tools which are included in this sandbox.

### Linear forcing of turbulent flows
The turbulence needs to be maintained in time to extract converged statistics of both the carrier flow and the droplets. 

Hence, a [new tool](linear_forcing/force_turbulence.h) is available to prescribe a couple of kinetic energy and dissipation rate ($k$,$\epsilon$) with an imposed integral length $\ell \sim 0.2\mathcal{L}$. This methodology is extended to two-phase flows and different test cases are available [in the related section](linear_forcing).

### Advanced postprocessing of droplets/bubbles from an Eulerian representation of the flow
The postprocessing of collisions can be done by using the implemented [extracting tool](collision_statistics/collision.h).

## Other works

### Conservation of momentum with multi-VOF
Using no-coalescence, the [momentum conserving algorithm](/src/navier-stokes/conserving.h) does not work if two droplets are close to each other.
For example, if a collision occurs, the momentum will not be correctly transported.
An adaptation of the algorithm when using the [multi-VOF method](/src/no-coalescence.h) is proposed in the related [in the related section](conserving-multi).
