# Revisiting the linear forcing of turbulence in two-phase flows
This foler contains the three solvers used to produce the results of 
[this paper](https://hal.science/hal-04542895v1):

* [Single-phase forcing of HIT](SP.c)
* [Two-phase forcing of droplet-laden HIT](TPD.c)
* [Two-phase forcing of emulsion HIT](TPE.c)

## Section III and IV: single-phase forcing with Basilisk
For this section, run the [SP](SP.c) test case with the different methods:

* The lundgren's (or constant-$A$) method with `#define TFMETH 0`
* The Carroll's (or constant-$\mathcal{P}_T$) method with `#define TFMETH 1`
* The Bassenne's constant-$k$ method with `#define TFMETH 4`
* The Bassenne's constant-$\epsilon$ method with `#define TFMETH 5`
* The Bassenne's hybrid method with `#define TFMETH 6`
* The proposed constant-$k\epsilon$ with `#define TFMETH 7`

## Section V: two-phase forcing
For this section, run the [TPD](TPD.c) and [TPE](TPD.c) test cases. 

### Exponential growth of kinetic energy
To test the different form of linear forcing to avoid the growth 
of mean kinetic energy just modify the parameter the `UMEAN`:

* The Lundgren's form `#define UMEAN 0`
* The Naso's form `#define UMEAN 1`
* The Yao's form `#define UMEAN 2`

### Two-phase contributions in the forcing
To include two-phase contributions in the linear forcing to improve the control
of $k$ and $\epsilon$ can be done by fixing `#define TFRHSNUM 1`.

## Section VI: indirect computation of budgets
The method proposed by Duret et al (2012) can be used to improve the results.
This can be done in the solver by modifying `#define TFRHSNUM 2`.
