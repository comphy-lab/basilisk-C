# Collision statistics of finite-size monodisperse droplets in homogeneous isotropic turbulence
This foler contains:

* The [header](collision.h) to post-process a droplet-laden flow 
and extract collision statistics from it.
* The [initialization of the HIT](initHIT.c) used as an input in 
the droplet-laden turbulence simulation.
* A [minimal test](collisionBinary.c) to verify the post-processing for a 
binary collision in 2D.
* The [droplet-laden HIT solver](collisionHIT.c) used to study the 
collision statistics.
