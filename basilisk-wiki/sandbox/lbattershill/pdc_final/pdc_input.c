/**
# Wave generation by fluidised flow. Three-phase Navier-Stokes with option for diffusion between two phases. This file implements a setup for a fixed input condition, 10 cm from the impact zone, where $h_f$ (impact height), $u_f$ (impact velocity) and $\theta$ can be defined by the user (UF, H0 AND THETA0). Please see [example script](http://basilisk.fr/sandbox/pdc_final/script).

This is the Navier-Stokes VOF case of the [Bougouin, 2020](#references) fluidized granular flow tsunami generation experiment.
