# Workshop on vorticity and free surface

I use this wiki to prepare the day-workshop on this topic under organized by the GRD MéPhy. The official page is here:[http://www.pmmh.espci.fr/~mephy/wiki/doku.php?id=rencontres:2015-4](http://www.pmmh.espci.fr/~mephy/wiki/doku.php?id=rencontres:2015-4)

Thanks to Stephane Popinet who hosts us on the wiki of his software Basilisk.

Please edit the list of participants with your name, lab and the topic you would like to talk about. If you would like to attend but not talk, please leave the topic empty. If there is a question mark at your topic, it means that I made something up for you, please modify to your liking.
