# Cartesian ,Stationnary, Uncompressible, Navier-Stokes with Jacobian resolution

Coded by [stab2014/Luis.m]() and [stab2014/PaulValcke.m](), on the initial [venturi.m]() code.

We took the Ventury code, initially created for cylindrical pipe flow. 
We changed the expression of the jacobian to adapt it to cartesian
coordinates.

This version explain all the structure of the code, there are alternates
version of the code here :

* Cartesian, **Unstationnary**, Uncompressible, Navier-Stokes with Jacobian
resolution: [NavierStokesUnStationnary.m]()

* **Cylindrical** ,Stationnary, Uncompressible, Navier-Stokes with Jacobian
resolution : [NavierStokesStationnaryCylindric]()

We present here a Poiseuille flow, we developped the code also for :

1.  [Poiseuille flow](NavierStokesStationnary.m) which is how a uniform Flow become a Poiseuille flow

2.  [backwardfacing step](BackwardsFacingStep.m) which is a Poiseuille Flow in a part of the left boundary

3.  [Cavity Lid Driven](CavityLidDriven.m) Which is 4 dirichlet condition for evey unknown, all homogenous but one (horizontal speed at the top). A smooth approach for easier convergence at high Reynolds is also presented.

4.  [Ventury](NavierStokesStationnaryCylindric) Which is a reformulation of Heopffner's (../Ventury.m) code. (in cylindric)


#Used Codes : you may find theses codes in diffpack :
* [chebdif.m]()
* [fddif.m]()
* [mapping2D.m]()
* [spd.m]() for sparse diagonal matrices
* [dif1D.m]()
* [dif2D.m]()
* [map2D.m]()

#How does this code works ?

I you are not totally familiar with the structures of codes in this website, you should read first [pedagogy.m]()

* First, we define the physical and numerical parameters of our simulation. We then calculate the differentiation matrixes : they contains all the information of the schemes you can use. 
They replace continous operators like derivates with Matrixes. 
The type of matrixe you use define the kind of interpolation polynoms you use (Tchebitchev, Fourier, Finite
differences...). See [diffmat.m]() and [pedagogy.m]() for more informations
* We do geometric transformation of our domain, transforming rectangular
initial domain to the form we want. See [Geometry.m]() (how to use it) and [map2D.m] (what is the tool) for more informations.
New differentiations matrixes are calculated according to plan
transformation.
* We define our Boundary conditions : we select all the index of boundaries
in "dir" and this kind of parameters. [pedagogy.m]() will explain you in details the theory
* We then define our initial guess. All our unknowns are on the same vectors,
one after the other one (for Navier-Stokes, we have U,V,P). We stock all of
them in the same vector Sol, u,v,p contain only the indexes of U,V,P in
Sol. (again, [pedagogy.m]() for more informations).
* We are now on the convergence loop
We define the functions we solve, in f, one after the other one (Here,
momentum conservation on x-axis, y-axis, mass conservation). 
We then define the jacobi of the functions, this matrix contains all the
informations about the derivates. It's a kind of ultimate tool for
linearisation, as it contains every slope you may ever need on your
problem. 
We apply our boundary conditions of the Jacobi and the function
We then do Newton iterations to find the solution, (see wikipedia page here
: ). As the jacobi is the general notion for the derivate, it works the
same.
We use relaxation method, wich imply more iteration to converge but it is
more stable.

# Comments

We take on purpose a very bad initial guess, just to show that it still
converge easily

We have a constant input, wich imply a zone where the flow is not
established.

We need to publish the figure, to check the form of the velocity, and to
check how long (in meters) it takes to correspond to poiseuille flow.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%DIFFERENTIATION MATRIXES%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% DIFFERENTIATION 
% We create here our matrixes of differentiatons of our system, on a
% rectangle domain. 
[d.x,d.xx,d.wx,x]=dif1D('fd',0,Lx,Nx,pts);
[d.y,d.yy,d.wy,y]=dif1D('fd',0,Ly,Ny,pts);
[D,l,X,Y,Z,I,NN]=dif2D(d,x,y);

% PLAN TRANSFORMATION
%You can transform X and Y as done in geometry

% We use Map2D to change our differentiations matrixes according to the
% transformation of X and Y
 D=map2D(X,Y,D);
 D.lap=D.xx+D.yy;

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%BOUNDARIES GESTION%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%We always proceed on the same way : we localise all the coordinates of the
%boundaries we are looking for, then we put them in the matrix C. 
%For Neumann, use D.vector
%For DIRICHLET, use vector

%%%% POSITIONS OF EVERY VECTORS
%u,v,p contain only the position u,v,p will have in SOL. 
u=(1:NN)'; v=u+NN; p=v+NN;
II=speye(3*NN);

%%%% EXAMPLE OF DIRICHLET ENTRY
dirInlet = [l.left];

% PRESSURE CONDITIONS
% Actually, we don't have any condition on Pressure and it works.
% On a poiseuille Flow, it would be smart to define D.xx*P instead of
% neumann condition, as Dp/Dx=cte in theorical solution. 
% Neumann condition will change the behaviours close to boundaries, so I
% consider it's better to put no conditions in

% BOUNDARY POSITIONS
%l.ctl correspond to the point at corner top left, cbr  corner bottom right...
%l.bot cotains all the indexes of point of the bottom but corner
dir=[l.ctl;l.ctr;l.cbl;l.cbr;l.left;l.top;l.bot;]; % where to put Dirichlet on u and v

% Loc will be used to apply boundary condition to the function 
loc=[u(dir); v(dir); 
    u(l.right); ...
    v(l.right)];

%MATRIX OF CONSTRAINTS   
C=[II([u(dir);v(dir)],:); % ...     % Dirichlet on u,v 
    D.x(l.right,:), Z(l.right,:), Z(l.right,:); ...   % Neuman on u at outflow
    Z(l.right,:),  D.x(l.right,:),Z(l.right,:)]; % ...    % Neumann on v at outflow


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%INITIAL GUESS%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%It needs to satisfy the boundary conditions, otherwise it will be very
%hard to converge to the good results. The best your initial guess is, the
%fastest your algorithm will work. If you have no convergence, try to do a
%better initial guess, this will help.
%Initial condition on U
U=(1-((Y(:,1)-Ly/2)/Ly*ones(1,Nx)).^2);
U(dirInlet)=1;

%Initial condition on V
V=zeros(NN,1);
V(dirInlet) = 0;
