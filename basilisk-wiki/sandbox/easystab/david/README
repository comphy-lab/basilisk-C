This page regroups the contributions of David Fabre to the Easystab project.

For info on my other research projects and my full list of publications, 
see [my professional page](https://www.imft.fr/FABRE-David-136) 

# Discretization methods

* [dif1D.m]() Added a number of options (mapped chebyshev, etc...) 

-> integrated in main project

* [differential_equation_fd_cheb.m]() Comparison of finite-difference and chebyshev (uses dif1D) 

-> to integrate in the main project

* [differential_equation_infinitedomain.m]() Test of discretization methods for resolution of 
a problem in an infinite domain using mapped chebyshev 

-> to integrate in the main project


# Dynamical systems

* [PhasePortrait_NonLinear.m]() Draws phase portraits for an number of classical 2D dynamical systems (lokta-voltera, brusselator, van der pol, pendulum, ...)

* [PhasePortrait_Linear.m]() Classification of equilibrium points for 2D problems

* [Lorenz.m]() Lorenz system

# Instability problems

* [GinsburgLandau.m]() Demonstration of the numerical resolution of an instability problem for a sample 1D problem.

In 2018/2019 this one was splitted in [GinsburgLandau_Linear.m]() and [GinsburgLandau_NonLinear.m]()


* [wave_like_Psi.m]() Basic example of wave-like perturbations in a channel ; comparison between UVP formulation (primitive), Psi formulation (Orr-Sommerfeld), and theory for SLIP conditions at the wall.


* [wave_like_Psi_noslip.m]() Same but modified for NO-SLIP conditions at the wall.

* [RayleighBenard.m]() No-slip condition, including loops over parameters to draw the neutral curve.

-> already integrated

* [KH_temporal_inviscid.m]() Kelvin-Helmholtz for the tanh shear layer. Uses chebyshev method with coordinate stretching.

-> To integrate in main project 

* [KH_temporal_viscous.m]() Same program in the viscous case. Plots a series of curves for various values of Re.

-> To integrate in main project

* [TS_PlanePoiseuille.m]()

Plane poiseuille : includes loops over k and Re to draw the neutral curve

-> to integrate in the main project

* [KH_temporal_viscous.m]()
