# Homogeneity

* Have grids that have smallest element first
* Have fddif and chebdif give grids in the same order

# Fluid

* Optimal transient growth in 1D and for venturi.m
* Use eigenmodes as initial condition in Gerris/Basilisk
* Rayleigh-Plateau instability
* Validate viscous Rayleigh-Taylor on lubrication model
* Feedback control?
* Capillary venturi in 2D (based first on [free_surface_2D.m]())

# Elasticity
* Elastic beam buckling instability
* Instability of beam on soft substrate

# Collaborations
* Boundary layers with Pyl
* Couette with two capillary surfaces with Fran√ßois
* vortices with Arnaud
* Nonlinear shape of a 2D and 3D beam (continuation) with Sebastien

# Gerris/Basilisk
* Make an initial condition of Gerris based on an eigenmode or steady state, also with free surfaces
* Get differentiation matrices from Basilisk

# Functionalities
* Run the code as preview
* edit files with two vertical columns
