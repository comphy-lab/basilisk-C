We studied a wave propagation on a string which lenght is L = 2 pi.
However we have defined different boundaries conditions from the original code : [../vibrating_string.m]()

One sinusoidal excitation on x = 0, and one straight point on the other end x= L
This can be translated mathematically by these expressions : 
 
$$f(x=0,t)= sin(\frac{t}{2\pi})$$
$$f(x=L,t)= 0$$
