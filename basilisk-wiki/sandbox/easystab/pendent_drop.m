# The shape of a pendent drop and the critical volume for dripping

The aim of this code is to compute the shape of a pendent drop situated at the lower end of a vertical pipe, assumed plane. With the use of a continuation procedure, the bifurcation diagram for increasing volume of the droplet is also drawn.
