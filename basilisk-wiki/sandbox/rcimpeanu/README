The sandbox will (soon!) contain work on projects pertaining to:

- drop impact at both low and high speeds (from bouncing to splashing),
- interfacial flow dynamics (also see [Oscar Holroyd's sandbox](http://basilisk.fr/_edit/sandbox/oaholroyd/)),
- bioreactor modelling,

mirroring and specialising activity on the [GitHub reserach group page](https://github.com/rcsc-group). For more details about the group's activity, [my personal webpage](https://www.raducimpeanu.com/) is just a click away as well.
