# Installation of the complete bview

## GL dependencies

To install the bview stuff, you first need to install OS-Mesa:

On debian-like system:

~~~bash
sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev libosmesa6-dev
~~~

On OS X:

~~~bash
sudo port install mesa
~~~

Then you need to compile the basilisk GL dependencies. For that, do:


On debian-like system:

~~~bash
cd $BASILISK/gl
make libglutils.a libfb_osmesa.a
~~~

On OS X:

~~~bash
cd $BASILISK/gl
CFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include make libglutils.a libfb_osmesa.a
~~~

On OS X 10.9 and above, you may seen some warning. You can safely ignore them.

## BVIEW-SERVERS

Now, we just need to install the bview-servers. For that, do:

On debian-like system and OS X:

~~~bash
cd $BASILISK
make bview-servers
~~~

On OS X 10.9 and above, you may seen some warning. You cans safely ignore them.

On OS X, the compilation may not work. It could be link to the fact that the GLU
library are not correctly link to OS-Mesa. For that, assuming that git is
install on your system, do:

~~~bash
cd
git clone https://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/mesa/glu.git/
cd glu
./autogen.sh
./configure --enable-osmesa --prefix=/usr/local/
make
sudo make install
~~~
