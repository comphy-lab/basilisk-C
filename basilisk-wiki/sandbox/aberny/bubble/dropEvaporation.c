/** 
With this small code, we want to obtain the evolution of a drop when knowing
its initial size and velocity. This code is taking into account the
evaporation of the droplets.

Concerning the evolution of the velocity, we have to take into account the drag
of the air arround the droplet. We also take into account the gravity. Then,
the general form of the equation driving the velocity of the droplet is:

$$ 
m_{droplet}\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = -\frac{1}{2}\rho_{air}S_{droplet}C_xv-m_{droplet}g
$$

We choose the following model for the drag coefficient: 

$$
C_x = \frac{24}{Re}\left(1+0.15Re^{0.687}\right)
$$

Concerning the radius of the droplet, it will change du to the evaporation of
the droplet during its evolution. The evaporation should compensate the amount
of water in the air that diffuse away from the droplet to the rest of the air.

We have: $$ \text{div}\left(\rho_{vap}v\right) = -\text{div}\left(j_{vap}\right)$$

We define the dimensionless number $Y_{vap} = \rho_{vap}/\rho_{air}$

We applie the Fick's law and the divergence theorem. We assume that the density
of the gaz is a constant. We then obtain:

$$
4\pi r^2_{droplet}\rho_{air}vY_{vap}-4\pi r^2D\rho\frac{dY_{vap}}{dr} = cst
$$

where $D$ is the duffision coefficient of water in the air.

The constant in this equation correspond to the mass variation $\dot{m}$. This
is explain by the fact that the divergence theorem is apply on a flux. This
flux is the variation of mass coming from the droplet. Assuming that we are
working with incompressible gazes, we can express the mass variation as:
$\dot{m} = 4\pi r^2\rho_{gaz}v$

Then the diffusion equation looks like:

$$
\dot{m} = \dot{m}Y_{vap}-4\pi r^2D\rho_{gaz}\frac{dY_{vap}}{dr}
$$

This droplet is moving. We assume that the diffusive boundary layer is a
perfect circle arround the droplet. Let $\delta M$ being the thickness of this
layer. We integrate the equation between $r_{droplet}$ and $r_{droplet}  +\delta
M$, and we get:

$$
\dot{m} = 4\pi D \rho_{gaz}r_{droplet}\left(\frac{r_{droplet}}{\delta M} +1\right)\text{ln}\left(B_M+1\right)
$$

where $B_M$ is the Spalding number. $B_m = \frac{Y_{vap}^{surf}-Y_{vap}^{\infty}}{1-Y_{vap}^{surf}}$

We know need to replace $\delta M$ by the actual size of the boundary layer. We choose the following model for the ratio $r_{droplet}/\delta M = 0.3\text{Sc}^{1/3}\text{Re}^{1/2}/F(B_M)$

By replacing everithing, we finally get the equation driving the evolution of
the radius of the droplet:

$$ \frac{dr_{droplet}}{dt} = -\frac{1}{r_{droplet}}\frac{\rho_{air}}{\rho_l}D\left(1+\frac{0.3\text{Sc}^{1/3}}{F(\text{Bm})} \left(\frac{\rho_{air} v r_{droplet}}{\mu_{air}}\right)^{1/2}\right)\text{ln}\left(1+\text{Bm}\right)
$$

where Sc is the Schmidt number, $\text{Sc} = \frac{\mu_{air}}{\rho_{air}D}$

We will compute the evolution of the velocity of the droplet but also the
evcolution of the droplet size. For that, we will solve a system coople system
of 2 differential equations. The system is:

$$ \frac{dr_{droplet}}{dt} = -\frac{1}{r_{droplet}}\frac{\rho_{air}}{\rho_l}D\left(1+\frac{0.3\text{Sc}^{1/3}}{F(\text{Bm})} \left(\frac{\rho_{air} v r_{droplet}}{\mu_{air}}\right)^{1/2}\right)\text{ln}\left(1+\text{Bm}\right)
$$

$$ \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = -\frac{9 \mu_{air}v}{r_{droplet}^2}\left(1+0.15\left(\frac{\rho_{air} r_{droplet} v}{\mu_{air}}\right)^{0.687}\right) - g$$

We want to have a dimensionless system. Indeed, the data we want to use, such as
the droplets parameters or the liquid parameters are dimensionless.

As a characteristic length scale, we use the radius of the bubble that generated
the liquid jet and the droplet we are working on.

For the fluid property, we will use the Laplace and the Bond numnber. They
express  as $\rho_{liq}\gamma R/\mu_{liq}^2$ and $\rho_{liq}g
R^2/\gamma$ respectivly.

We assume that we work with water and air. For that, we then fix the viscosity
and the density ratio. We have:

$$
\frac{\rho_{air}}{\rho_{liq}} = \frac{1}{998} \quad \frac{\mu_{air}}{\mu_{liq}}=\frac{1}{55}
$$

Finally, concerning the timescale, we will use the same time-scale as the one
used for the bursting bubble problem. This problem is driven by surface tension
forces. This imply that we are working arround the capillary length scale. At
the capillary scale, there is propagation of capilary wave. We will then use 
the inverse of the frequency for our characteristiq time-scale. This time is 
also called the capillary time-scale. It is define as $t_c = \sqrt{\frac{\rho 
R_{Bubble}^3}{\gamma}}$.

With all that said, the velocity must be dimensionless, as the derivation of 
the position with respect to the time (both of them are dimensionless).

Since we are playing with the liquid parameters, we choose to have the liquid 
density as a characteristic density, which fix it to 1, and fix $\gamma$ to 1, 
so the only fluid parameters that is changing is the viscosity. We set the 
liquid viscosity a the "main" viscosity, since the Laplace number is using the 
liquid property.

With all that set, the liquid viscosity can be express as: $1/\sqrt{La}$.

The gaz properties are then define with the liquid parameters:

$$
\rho_{air}= \rho_{liq}\frac{\rho_{air}}{\rho_{liq}} \quad
\mu_{air} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{La}}\frac{\mu_{air}}{\mu_{liq}}
$$

To transform the capillary number used for the velocity, with $Ca =
\mu_{liq}/\gamma v$ to a velocity that is in the code "units" system, we just
multiply Ca by $\gamma\sqrt{La}$.

The droplet radius $r_{droplet}$ is in fact the ratio between the original
radius of the bubble generating the droplet and the droplet. We will keep
noting it $r_{droplet}$. The same rule applies to $v$, since the velocity is
express in the "bursting bubble unit system" (see the simulation for more
information).

The bond number $\rho R^2 g/\gamma$ is just defining the gravity, since all the
other parameters are charectistic parameters of the problem.

We note $\rho_r = \rho_{air}/\rho_{liq}$ and $\mu_r = \mu_{air}/\mu_{liq}$

The equation system can know be transform into a dimensionless system, assuming
that $\rho_{liq}$ is a dimensionless parameter, equal to 1.

$$
\frac{dr_{droplet}}{dt} = -\frac{1}{r_{droplet}}\rho_r
\frac{1}{Sc} \sqrt{\frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt{La}}\mu_r}{\rho_l\rho_r}}
\left(\sqrt{\frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt{La}}\mu_r}{\rho_l\rho_r}}+
\frac{0.3\text{Sc}^{1/3}}{F(\text{Bm})} \sqrt{v r_{droplet}}\right)\text{ln}\left(1+\text{Bm}\right)
$$

$$ 
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = 
-\frac{9 \frac{1}{\sqrt{La}}\mu_{r}v}{r_{droplet}^2}
\left(1+0.15\left(\frac{\rho_{liq}\rho_r }{\frac{\mu_r}{\sqrt{La}}}
r_{droplet} v\right)^{0.687}\right) - \text{Bo}
$$

The liquid condition will be set as input parameters (with the use of the
Laplace number).

For our equation, we will also need an initial condition in velocity and in
size. This will be set with an input parameters for this code.

Finaly, there is also the external condition, impacting the evaporation of the
liquid. We will work with water, in the air. The external pressure will be 1013
hPa. We will set the air and the water temperature at 20째C. The humidity rate
will be set to 80%, since we are evaporating water droplet above a huge surface
of water.
