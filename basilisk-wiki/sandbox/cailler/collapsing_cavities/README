  title: Simulations of conical collapsing cavities
---

A bubble has just burst at the ocean free surface, then, collapses: 
the conical formed cavity develops a self-similar evolution leading to a 
*finite-time singularity* coming from the balance between inertia and capillary 
forces. As already shown in [`keller_miksis`](http://basilisk.fr/sandbox/cailler/keller_miksis/keller_fig2_conv.c) 
and [`sierou_lister`](http://basilisk.fr/sandbox/cailler/sierou_lister/sierou_dipolar_flow.c) 
projects, this collapse evolves according to the power law $(t_0 - t)^{2/3}$, 
where $t_0$ is the time of singularity (divergence of velocity and pressure 
fields).

  </figcaption>
</figure>

If we assume that the collapse does not leave the self-similar route, 
the same interface shape should recur indefinitely, without even 
reaching the singularity, since there exists an infinity of scales between 
$t_0$ and the time under consideration. To put it in other words, it would be 
*impossible* to go *beyond* the singularity. 

This problem of infinite divisibility of space and time was first stated as the 
*Achilles and the tortoise paradox* by 
[*Zeno of Elea*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Elea) (Vth--century BC 
Greek philosopher). In his argument, the famous hero *Achilles* is in a footrace 
with a tortoise having initially some advance on him. For the Eleatic, although 
*Achilles* is able to reach the initial position of the tortoise, the latter has 
covered a finite distance during the same duration of time keeping the hero at 
bay. *Achilles* reaches again quickly the new reptile's position, but the tortoise 
has moved forward so that a gap still exists bteween the two runners. 

By iterating the process, the philosopher declares that it is **impossible** for 
*Achilles* to catch up with the tortoise, as it will always have a head start on 
the hero, no matter the infinitesimal scale.

However, this paradox is easily solved by noticing the **finiteness** of time 
during which *Achilles* reaches the tortoise, so that timesteps between each 
process described by *Zeno of Elea* tend to *zero*.

Going back to our problem, it means that to solve numerically a finite-time 
singularity of a collapsing cavity -- that is to say forming a *perfect cone* -- 
one should approach it indefinitely as the likes of *Achilles* and the tortoise; 
therefore having an *infinite mesh resolution* $\Delta$. Nonetheless, due to the 
[CFL condition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courant%E2%80%93Friedrichs%E2%80%93Lewy_condition), 
it also means that corresponding timesteps $\Delta t$ are becoming infinitesimal, 
so calculations never end! 
An arbitrarily infinite numerical precision being not scaled for human time, 
the finiteness of the grid resolution necessarily implies to cross the fictitious 
horizon of the cone by some "numerical defect", leaving then the self-similar 
route by artificial/non-physical means.

Luckily for the expected numerical work to be done, collapsing cavities of 
bursted bubbles ends experimentally (and numerically too!) to **liquid jets** 
formation, *i.e.* in reality, something physically happens *beyond* the 
singularity at $t_0$ that can not be predicted by the self-similar solution. 
This scale invariance is therefore *physically* left in its ultimate moments, 
when the curvature reversal occurs, allowing to pass from a conical structure 
to a jet one. 

Hence, we are let to figure out the physical mechanism for crossing the singularity 
horizon by a numerical approach, and not only by some "numerical defect". 


# "Ultraviolet cutoffs"

Indeed, in the experiment of *Faraday waves* developed by 
[Zeff *et al.*, (2000)](#zeff2000), a topological diversity of collapsing cavity shapes 
close to the curvature singularity is exhibited and linked with various jet 
velocities (*see figure below*): 

![Different surface depressions for various surface wave amplitudes ([Zeff *et al.*, 2000](#zeff2000))](img_collapsing/collapsing_zeff_cavities.png){width="32%"}

When wave amplitudes $h$ are less than a critical threshold $h_c$, the cavity 
interface close to the singularity keeps a smooth curvature evolution, and the 
jets produced are of moderate speed $(7 \text{ m/s})$. 
For amplitudes around $h_c$, the cavity walls are becoming parallel to the 
symmetry axis, and the resulting jet can reach $50 \text{ m/s}$! 
Finally, for $h > h_c$, *bubble pinchoffs* are observed and are responsible for 
the velocity drop occurring at the jet's tip $(6 \text{ m/s})$. 

The authors also remark that with the increase of the flow velocity, the apex 
of the collapsing cone becomes *blunt*. To explain this change of topology and 
the saturation of the jets velocities instead of the expected self-similar 
singularity, a *viscous "ultraviolet cutoff"* argument -- happening right before 
the curvature reversal -- is developed.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">
  Drop impacts on a superhydrophobic surface
  </figcaption>
</figure>

A similar argument of "*cutoff mechanism*" can be found in the paper of 
[Bartolo *et al.*, (2006)](#bartolo2006) where drop impacts on a superhydrophobic 
surface have been studied (see adjacent figure). 
In this experiment, liquid jets' formation can be preceded by trapped bubbles, 
depending on the velocity impact. In the latter case, complex topological events 
occurr and from which emerge thin and very fast jets. 
The authors suggest an analogy between these shape changes and the divergence of 
the velocity of the jets with the capillary-inertial singularities of 
[Zeff *et al.*, (2000)](#zeff2000) or the simulated bursting bubbles of 
[Duchemin *et al.*, (2002)](#duchemin2002), since they observe approximately 
over a time decade a self-similar behaviour scaling as $(t_0 - t)^{2/3}$ for 
the liquid jets profiles.

However, without any experimental device fast enough to follow the extremely rapid 
dynamics of the collapsing cavity prefiguring the jet's formation, the question 
remains for a capillary-inertial self-similar collapse concerning the drop impacts, 
even though the authors claim that:

> "*Theoretically there is no reason why the length scales [of the ultrafast collapse dynamics]* 
*should not follow the same* $|t - t_0|^{2/3}$ *behavior after the singularity.*"

Nonetheless, this claim is nuanced by the suggestion of an intrinsic length 
scale responsible for the *ultraviolet cutoff* of the singularity. 
Consequently, the issue of the regularization mechanism is still not addressed.


# How can we numerically prepare a *singular state*?

In both experiments of [Zeff *et al.*, (2000)](#zeff2000) and 
[Bartolo *et al.*, (2006)](#bartolo2006), the authors have great difficulties 
to capture the ultimate moments linking the cavity collapse to the liquid jet. 
But their measured jet's velocities are **finite**, therefore imply a 
*physical regularization* of the singularity at the curvature reversal; to put 
it in other words, the capillary-inertial self-similar regime *has to be left*. 
In that case, how could we understand the origin of this physical mechanism?


## Time reversals of recoiling cones

In another project ([`sierou_lister`](http://basilisk.fr/sandbox/cailler/sierou_lister/)), 
the self-similar recoil of a 3D--AXI cone submitted to strong negative
[*dipolar flows*](http://basilisk.fr/sandbox/cailler/sierou_lister/README) 
highlighted the development of [*jet structures*](http://basilisk.fr/sandbox/cailler/sierou_lister/sierou_neg_dipolar_flow.c#discussion). 
This important result was an extension of the paper of [Sierou \& Lister, (2004)](#sierou2004) 
and will be widely used in our simulations. 
But another fundamental aspect of *Sierou \& Lister*'s work still not exploited 
is the following crucial remark: 

<div class="message">
<div id="msg_logo"><img src="/img/warning.png"></div>
**Fundamental Remark**

  <p style="text-align: center">
  For potential flows, collapsing cavities of bursting bubbles correspond to a 
  **time reversal** of a surface tension driven recoil of conical interfaces 
  having an open angle $\theta_0$ with their axis of symmetry larger than $90$Â°.
  </p>
</div>

Actually, for an irrotational, inviscid and incompressible flow, the following 
dynamic and kinematic boundary conditions in self-similar form are found to be, 
according to [*this note*](http://basilisk.fr/sandbox/cailler/sierou_lister/README#far-field-self-similar-asymptotic-expansions) (see notations there):

$$
- \dfrac{1}{3}{\overline{\phi}^-} 
  + \dfrac{2}{3} \overline{R} \, \partial_{\overline{R}} \overline{\phi}^-
  + \dfrac{1}{2} \left[
    \left(
      \partial_{\overline{R}} \overline{\phi}^- 
    \right)^2
    + \dfrac{1}{{\overline{R}}^2} \left(
      \partial_{\theta} \overline{\phi}^- 
    \right)^2
  \right]
  + \overline{\kappa} 
  = 0
$$
$$
- \overline{R} \, \partial_{\overline{R}} \overline{\phi}^\pm \, 
\partial_{\overline{R}} \overline{F} 
+ \dfrac{1}{\overline{R}} \partial_{\theta} \overline{\phi}^\pm  
- \dfrac{2}{3} {\overline{R}}^2 \, \partial_{\overline{R}} \overline{F} 
= 0
$$

The very same equations are recovered for the *pre-pinching* of drops, or similarly 
for collapsing cavities. 
Now, the change of variable $(t_0 - t) \to (t - t_0)$ leads to 
$\overline{\phi}^\pm \to - \overline{\phi}^\pm$, so 
$\mathbf{\overline{u}}^\pm \to - \mathbf{\overline{u}}^\pm$, hence the *Laplace* 
equation $\boldsymbol{\nabla} \overline{\phi}^\pm = 0$ is let invariant. 
However, the boundary conditions are now equivalent to a *post-pinching* formulation 
used for simulating recoiling cones:

$$
\dfrac{1}{3}{\overline{\phi}^-} 
  - \dfrac{2}{3} \overline{R} \, \partial_{\overline{R}} \overline{\phi}^-
  + \dfrac{1}{2} \left[
    \left(
      \partial_{\overline{R}} \overline{\phi}^- 
    \right)^2
    + \dfrac{1}{{\overline{R}}^2} \left(
      \partial_{\theta} \overline{\phi}^- 
    \right)^2
  \right]
  + \overline{\kappa} 
  = 0
$$
$$
\overline{R} \, \partial_{\overline{R}} \overline{\phi}^\pm \, 
\partial_{\overline{R}} \overline{F} 
- \dfrac{1}{\overline{R}} \partial_{\theta} \overline{\phi}^\pm  
- \dfrac{2}{3} {\overline{R}}^2 \, \partial_{\overline{R}} \overline{F} 
= 0
$$

Consequently, we do have the conclusion that a recoiling cone is no more than the 
time reversal of a collapsing cavity (at least for the inviscid case).


## New physical interpretation for dipolar flows

From the numerical studies upon a recoiling liquid cone submitted to a far-field 
dipolar flow (see [`sierou_dipolar_flow.c`](http://basilisk.fr/sandbox/cailler/sierou_lister/sierou_dipolar_flow.c) and [`sierou_neg_dipolar_flow.c`](http://basilisk.fr/sandbox/cailler/sierou_lister/sierou_neg_dipolar_flow.c)), we have seen that (for $\theta_0 > 90$Â°):

  * for $\widetilde{\mu}_0 > 0$, beyond a given threshold $\widetilde{\mu}_0^*$ 
  depending on the initial cone angle, the dipolar flow overcomes the capillary 
  one, therefore the obtuse cone *moves back*;
  * for $\widetilde{\mu}_0 \leqslant 0$, the dipolar flow strengthens the capillary 
  one, so that the obtuse liquid cone *moves forward*, developping potentially 
  jet structures;
  * the more $|\widetilde{\mu}_0|$ increases, the bigger the displacements of 
  the apex for $\widetilde{\mu}_0 < 0$ (for the opposite sign of 
  $\widetilde{\mu}_0$, the displacement are getting smaller). 

Given now that these movements are related to a kinematic reversal of a collapsing 
cavity, the dipolar flow $\mu_d$ can be linked to a **draining flow** of the 
said cavity, close to the singularity, as shown on the below figure:

![Illustration of the link between $\widetilde{\mu}_0$ and the time reversal](img_collapsing/collapsing_time_reversal.png){width="40%"}

Indeed, if $\widetilde{\mu}_0 > 0$ is larger than the threshold value 
$\widetilde{\mu}_0^*(\theta_0 > 90$Â°$)$, then an initially still obtuse liquid 
cone *recoils* due to the dipolar flow counteracting force against the surface 
tension ones, and moves *away* from its initial singular state (*left figure*). 
By applying the change of variable $t \to - t$ (*time reversal*), 
a **kinematic reversal** $\mathbf{u} \to - \mathbf{u}$ occurs, and consequently 
$\widetilde{\mu}_0 \to - \widetilde{\mu}_0 < 0$ (*centered figure*). Now, the 
recoiling cone has become a finite-time singularity represented by the collapse 
of a cavity of air. After the reformation of the singular state, a *jet structure* 
appears in the post-singular state, with still $\widetilde{\mu}_0 < 0$ (*right figure*).


## General method for approaching a singularity

Thanks to the previous results, we are now able to build a numerical protocol 
allowing us to simulate the convergence of a cavity towards a perfect cone. 
The very first step will be to verify the kinematic invariance for inviscid 
flows between a recoiling cone and a collapsing conical interface (by using 
the idea illustrated in the first two sub-figures of the previous scheme). 
Then, with the help of physical quantities of interest, like the liquid density, 
its viscosity and surface tension, a *viscous length scale* $\ell_\mu$ and a 
*viscous time scale* $t_\mu$ can be built to characterize viscous collapses. 
At time $t_0 - t \approx t_\mu$ and length $\kappa^{-1} \approx \ell_\mu$, 
we can reasonably expect viscosity to play a dominant role. 

Hence, we will be able to study if crossing physically the singularity's 
horizon is possible via a regularization mechanism triggered at viscous scales.


# Comparing inviscid and viscous simulations

Our goal being to characterize the possible viscosity effects close to the 
finite-time singularity, having a method to compare with inviscid simulations 
is therefore essential.

## Viscous scales and orders of magnitude

Adding viscosity effects to our simulations is responsible for the emergence 
of typical space and time scales. The liquid phase is described by its density 
$\rho_l$, its dynamic viscosity $\mu_l$, the gas phase by $\rho_g$ and $\mu_g$, 
and the interface separating them by the surface tension $\sigma$. We can then 
build a *viscous length scale*:

$$
\ell_\mu = \dfrac{{\mu_l}^2}{\rho_l \sigma}
$$

equating to $10 \text{ nm}$ in water and $0.1 \text{ mm}$ for a one-hundred more 
viscous oil than water. Obviously, a *viscous time scale* can also be built:

$$
t_\mu = \dfrac{{\mu_l}^3}{\rho_l \sigma^2}
$$

equating $10^{-10} \text{ s}$ in water and $0.1 \text{ ms}$ in the same oil. By 
dividing these two typical scales, a *viscous velocity* is easily formed:

$$
V_\mu = \dfrac{\ell_\mu}{t_\mu} 
$$

equating $70 \text{ m/s}$ in water, and $0.5 \text{ m/s}$ in the specific oil. 
Finally, an estimate of the maximum pressure developed in presence of viscosity 
can be made thanks to the following principle: for a collapsing cavity of a 
bursted bubble, it is reasonable to consider that the capillary-inertial 
self-similar evolution stops when the viscous length scale is reached. 
Mathematically, it means that:

$$
\left(
  \dfrac{\sigma (t_0 - t)^2}{\rho_l} 
\right)^{1/3}
\sim 
\dfrac{{\mu_l}^2}{\rho_l \, \sigma} \equiv \ell_\mu
\Rightarrow 
(t_0 - t) \sim \dfrac{{\mu_l}^3}{\rho_l \, \sigma^2} 
\equiv t_\mu
$$

Thus, in a self-similar description, the maximum pressure developed into the 
liquid phase at viscous times is approximately:

$$
p_{max} \sim \rho_l \left(
  \dfrac{\sigma^2}{{\rho_l}^2 \, (t_0 - t)^2}
\right)^{1/3} 
\sim \rho_l \left(
  \dfrac{\sigma}{\mu_l}
\right)^2
$$

equating to $100 \text{ bar}$ in water, and $10^{-2} \text{ bar}$ in the oil.



## Dimensional Analysis 

In the presence of surface tension, inertia, viscosity, and a far-field dipolar 
flow $\mu_d$, every field $X$ characterizing the axisymmetric flow depends on the 
following parameters:

$$
  X = f(r, z, t, \rho_l, \rho_g, \sigma, \mu_l, \mu_g, \theta_0, \mu_d) 
$$

with only $3$ independent dimensions (length, mass, time) needed to describe the 
problem. According to the *Vaschy--Buckingham* theorem, this relation can be 
rewritten in function of $11 - 3 = 8$ dimensionless quantities. We choose then 
the three quantities $(\rho_l, \sigma, \mu_l)$ dimensionally independent in order 
to build the following dimensionless quantities:

$$
\Pi 
  = \Phi\left(
  \dfrac{r}{\ell_\mu}, \dfrac{z}{\ell_\mu}, \dfrac{t}{t_\mu}, 
  \dfrac{\rho_g}{\rho_l}, \dfrac{\mu_g}{\mu_l}, \theta_0, 
  \dfrac{\mu_d}{{\ell_\mu}^2/t_\mu }
\right)
  = \Phi\left(
    \tilde{r}, \tilde{z}, \tilde{t}, 
    \dfrac{\rho_g}{\rho_l}, \dfrac{\mu_g}{\mu_l}, \theta_0, 
    \widetilde{\mu}_d
  \right)
$$



## Link between viscous and inviscid non-dimensionalizations 

We are now able to compare the different contributions of capillary-inertial 
forces and viscous forces to the *Navier--Stokes* equations that are expressed 
in `Basilisk` by:

$$
\left\{\begin{array}{rcl}
  \rho_l \left( 
  \partial_t \mathbf{u} 
  + \left( \mathbf{u} \cdot \boldsymbol{\nabla}\right) \mathbf{u}
  \right)
  &=&
  - \boldsymbol{\nabla} p + \mu_l \boldsymbol{\nabla}^2 \mathbf{u} 
  + \sigma \kappa \boldsymbol{\nabla} C 
  \quad \text{in the liquid}\\
  \rho_g \left( 
  \partial_t \mathbf{u} 
  + \left( \mathbf{u} \cdot \boldsymbol{\nabla}\right) \mathbf{u}
  \right)
  &=&
  - \boldsymbol{\nabla} p + \mu_g \boldsymbol{\nabla}^2 \mathbf{u} 
  + \sigma \kappa \boldsymbol{\nabla} C 
  \quad \text{in the gas}
\end{array}
\right.
$$

recalling that $C$ stands for the volume fraction. 
To do so, we will non-dimensionalize this set of equations depending on the 
choice made (inviscid or viscous simulation).


### Viscous non-dimensionalization

If we non-dimensionalize the problem with the triplet $(\rho_l, \sigma, \mu_l)$, 
then we have the following dimensionless quantities (represented with a *tilde*):

$$
\mathbf{u} = \dfrac{\sigma}{\mu_l} \, \mathbf{\widetilde{u}}
\quad ; \quad 
t = \dfrac{{\mu_l}^3}{\rho_l \, \sigma^2} \, \tilde{t} 
\quad ; \quad 
p = \rho_l \, \left( \dfrac{\sigma}{\mu_l} \right)^2 \, \tilde{p}
\quad ; \quad 
\kappa = \dfrac{\rho_l \, \sigma}{{\mu_l}^2} \, \widetilde{\kappa} 
$$
$$
r = \dfrac{{\mu_l}^2}{\rho_l \, \sigma} \, \tilde{r} 
\quad ; \quad
z = \dfrac{{\mu_l}^2}{\rho_l \, \sigma} \, \tilde{z} 
\quad ; \quad 
\Delta = \dfrac{{\mu_l}^2}{\rho_l \, \sigma} \, \widetilde{\Delta} 
\quad ; \quad 
C = \widetilde{C}
$$

and the previous set of *Navier--Stokes* equations becomes:

$$
\left\{\begin{array}{rcl} 
  \partial_{\tilde{t}} \mathbf{\widetilde{u}} 
  + \left( \mathbf{\widetilde{u}} \cdot \widetilde{\boldsymbol{\nabla}}\right) 
  \mathbf{\widetilde{u}}
  &=&
  - \widetilde{\boldsymbol{\nabla}} \tilde{p}
  + \widetilde{\boldsymbol{\nabla}}^2 \mathbf{\widetilde{u}} 
  + \widetilde{\kappa} \, \widetilde{\boldsymbol{\nabla}} \widetilde{C} 
  \quad \text{in the liquid}\\
  \partial_{\tilde{t}} \mathbf{\widetilde{u}} 
  + \left( \mathbf{\widetilde{u}} \cdot \widetilde{\boldsymbol{\nabla}}\right) 
  \mathbf{\widetilde{u}}
  &=&
  \textcolor{Orchid}{\dfrac{\rho_l}{\rho_g}} \left(
  - \widetilde{\boldsymbol{\nabla}} \tilde{p} 
  + \textcolor{orange}{\dfrac{\mu_g}{\mu_l}} \, 
  \widetilde{\boldsymbol{\nabla}}^2 \mathbf{\widetilde{u}} 
  + \widetilde{\kappa} \, \widetilde{\boldsymbol{\nabla}} \widetilde{C} 
  \right)
  \quad \text{in the gas}
\end{array}
\right.
$$



### Inviscid non-dimensionalization

In an inviscid modelling, without any characteristic length scale, it is 
necessary to introduce a typical length to non-dimensionalize the variables. 
Let $L$ be this arbitrary length, so that, by using the triplet 
$(\rho_l, \sigma, L)$, we do have the following dimensionless quantities:

$$
\mathbf{u} = \sqrt{\dfrac{\sigma}{L \, \rho_l}} \, \mathbf{\widetilde{u}}
\quad ; \quad 
t = \sqrt{\dfrac{L^3 \, \rho_l}{\sigma}} \, \tilde{t} 
\quad ; \quad 
p = \dfrac{\sigma}{L} \, \tilde{p}
\quad ; \quad 
\kappa = \dfrac{1}{L} \, \widetilde{\kappa} 
$$
$$
r = L \, \tilde{r} 
\quad ; \quad
z = L \, \tilde{z} 
\quad ; \quad 
\Delta = L \, \widetilde{\Delta} 
\quad ; \quad 
C = \widetilde{C}
$$

and the dimensionless *Navier-Stokes* equations read as:

$$
\left\{\begin{array}{rcl} 
  \partial_{\tilde{t}} \mathbf{\widetilde{u}} 
  + \left( \mathbf{\widetilde{u}} \cdot \widetilde{\boldsymbol{\nabla}}\right) 
  \mathbf{\widetilde{u}}
  &=&
  - \widetilde{\boldsymbol{\nabla}} \tilde{p}
  + \textcolor{red}{\mathrm{Oh}} \, 
  \widetilde{\boldsymbol{\nabla}}^2 \mathbf{\widetilde{u}} 
  + \widetilde{\kappa} \, \widetilde{\boldsymbol{\nabla}} \widetilde{C} 
  \quad \text{in the liquid}\\
  \partial_{\tilde{t}} \mathbf{\widetilde{u}} 
  + \left( \mathbf{\widetilde{u}} \cdot \widetilde{\boldsymbol{\nabla}}\right) 
  \mathbf{\widetilde{u}}
  &=&
  \textcolor{Orchid}{\dfrac{\rho_l}{\rho_g}} \left(
  - \widetilde{\boldsymbol{\nabla}} \tilde{p} 
  + \textcolor{orange}{\dfrac{\mu_g}{\mu_l}} \,
  \textcolor{red}{\mathrm{Oh}} \, \, 
  \widetilde{\boldsymbol{\nabla}}^2 \mathbf{\widetilde{u}} 
  + \widetilde{\kappa} \, \widetilde{\boldsymbol{\nabla}} \widetilde{C} 
  \right)
  \quad \text{in the gas}
\end{array}
\right.
$$

where $\mathrm{Oh}$ is the *Ohnesorge number* of the liquid:

$$
\mathrm{Oh} = \dfrac{\mu_l}{\sqrt{\sigma \, \rho_l \, L}}
$$


### Non-dimensionalization used and why

As we can see, the inviscid and viscous non-dimensionalizations of the 
*Navier--Stokes* equations solved in `Basilisk` only differ from the presence 
or absence of the *Ohnesorge* number $\mathrm{Oh}$. Consequently:

  * for inviscid simulations, $\mu_l = \mu_g = 0 \Rightarrow \mathrm{Oh} = 0$ 
  and the arbitrary length $L$ introduced does not play any role;
  * let $\mathrm{Oh} = 1$ be in the inviscid formulation: doing so, we recover 
  the *viscous* non-dimensionalization, providing that $\ell_\mu$ becomes the 
  characteristic length scale, since $L \equiv \ell_\mu \Leftrightarrow \mathrm{Oh} = 1$. 


<div class="message">
<div id="msg_logo"><img src="/img/warning.png"></div>
**Fundamental Remark**

  <p style="text-align: center">
  To compare viscous simulations with inviscid ones, we choose to 
  non-dimensionalize our variables according to the **capillary-inertial description** 
  that is independent of the simulation size domain when viscosity is zero. 
  We can then place ourselves directly at the characteristic length scale of the 
  viscous problem, $L = \ell_\mu$, to match the inviscid non-dimensionalization 
  with the viscous one when $\mu_l, \, \mu_g \neq 0$. 
  This allows us to rigorously take the same size domain and grid resolution for 
  our numerical experiments.
  </p>
</div>

One can notice also the strict equivalence of the dimensionless times between 
both formulations, since plugging $\ell_\mu$ into the capillary-inertial time 
$t_\sigma := \sqrt{L^3 \rho_l / \sigma}$, we get the viscous time 
$t_\mu = {\mu_l}^3 / (\rho_l \sigma^2)$.


### Conclusion

The conceptual difficulty comes from the fact we are using specific viscous scales 
to set/design general parameters for our simulations (grid size, resolution, 
time reversal...) while we are relying on the 
[inviscid non-dimensionalization formulation](#inviscid-non-dimensionalization) 
of a scale invariant problem in order to compare the two types of simulations 
(viscous/inviscid).
