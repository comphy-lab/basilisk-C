This is *Nicolas Cailler*'s sandbox, in which you will find `Basilisk C` codes 
upon **self-similar** solutions for the collapse of fluid interfaces and 
other scale invariant problems. 

The work done with `Basilisk` has been undertaken during a PhD thesis (2021--2024) 
supervised by [Arnaud ANTKOWIAK](http://www.lmm.jussieu.fr/~antkowiak/) 
and [Régis WUNENBURGER](https://regiswunenburger.wixsite.com/sitesu) at 
[Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en), in the lab 
[Institut Jean Le Rond $\partial$'Alembert](http://www.dalembert.upmc.fr/ijlrda/). 

The defense of the PhD is broadcast on 
[*YouTube*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwa9gNFYL7o), 
and the manuscript can be read online on the 
[HAL portal](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04965377), whereas a 
summarized presentation of the main goals of the thesis for the 
[BGUM 2023](http://basilisk.fr/BGUM2023/cailler.pdf) can be found on this 
very website.

# Existing Directories

<video controls src="lamb_oseen/selfsim_lamb_blackhole/movie_selfsim_blackhole_N8.mp4" style = float:right width="311px">Collapsing conical cavity</video>

* [`collapsing_cavities`](collapsing_cavities/): We show how the horizon of a 
  finite-time singularity is crossed for (self-similar) collapsing cavities, 
  such as a bursting bubble. 

* [`keller_miksis`](keller_miksis/): The surface-tension-driven 
  recoil of a liquid wedge is investigated, a problem addressed by *Keller \& Miksis* 
  in 1983. The scale invariant nature of the phenomenon is exhibited, and we 
  provide with `Basilisk` an update of the authors' results.

* [`lamb_oseen`](lamb_oseen/): A numerical study of the *Lamb--Oseen* vortex, 
  highlighting the self-similar behaviour of the developing flow, firstly when 
  working from the physical space, and secondly by performing direct numerical 
  simulations in the associated self-similar space. 

* [`self_sim_DNS`](self_sim_DNS/): For the first time is implemented and 
  documented an incompressible *Navier--Stokes* solver directly written in 
  self-similar coordinates, therefore enabling to spontaneously and 
  spectacularly converge towards *steady* solutions for scale invariant 
  phenomena. Performing a DNS in the "right" space allows us to compute 
  simulations that would not be possible otherwise, in terms of running time.

* [`sierou_lister`](sierou_lister/): The self-similar surface-tension-driven 
  recoil of a 3D--AXI liquid cone is investigated, a problem addressed 
  by *Sierou \& Lister* in 2004. We recover and extend the results of the 
  authors, especially by applying stronger far-field dipolar flows upon 
  the overall capillary one. In particular, self-similar capillary-inertial 
  **jet structures** are discovered for the strongest intensities. 

* [`test_cases`](test_cases/): Tests and useful explanations on customized 
  libraries widely used in the other projects of this *sandbox* are found there. 
  In particular: 

    + The management of ghost cell volume fraction values for boundaries crossed 
    by a no-closed, mobile interface, in [`vel_tan`](test-cases/vel_tan/); 
    + An implementation of *Legendre* polynomials of fractional degree, in 
    [`legendre_polynomials`](test-cases/legendre_polynomials/).
