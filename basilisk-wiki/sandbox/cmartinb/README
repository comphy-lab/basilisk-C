# Broadband Wave Field with a Turbulent Boundary Layer

This sandbox contains the code, (some) data and results associated with my work on modeling the broadband wave field interacting with a turbulent boundary layer in the air. The aim is to simulate and analyze the dynamics of wave propagation at various scales in the presence of turbulence, providing insights into energy dissipation and wave characteristics.
