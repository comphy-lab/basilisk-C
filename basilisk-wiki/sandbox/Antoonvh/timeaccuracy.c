/**
# The Navier-Stokes solver is second-order accurate in time
Let us test that for a 1D viscous-flow problem, evaluated on a 2D grid.

##set-up
The set-up consists of a periodic (left-right) channel with no-slip boundary conditions (top-bottom). The initialized flow is:

$$ \overrightarrow{u_0}(x,y)= (u_0,v_0) =(\mathrm{cos}(y),0),$$

for $\mathrm{abs}(y) \leq \pi/2  $. Due to the fluid's viscousity ($\nu$), momemtum will diffuse over time, according to the (Navier-)Stokes equation, that is solved by;

$$\overrightarrow{u}(t)= \overrightarrow{u_0}e^{-\nu t}.$$

This equation will help to determine the error due to the time integration.
