#Website

Recent activity: The highlighted yellow/strike-out markup for changes is good, but clicking 'view' takes me to the previous version (unless its a new page) where I would have expected to view the updated one.

Links : Images and movies could behave the same

Uploading a .c.page file via darcs does not run it automatically

Do files really need the "pagename." prefix if you want to load them in the code.

I would like (the option) to copy & paste in the editor with CUA keys (Ctrl + c , x, v)

Pages should maybe not have to start with a comment block?

[This](/src/grid/tree-mpi.h) bothers me more than it should

gnuplotting is different in the sandbox compared to my local installment (fonts, terminals, default colors etc). 

A progress bar for running would be nice but seems unfeasible? 

Maybe delineate between save/preview and running for some minimal safety? (still not very safe and requires an extra button)

The frontpage could be more concise, possibly linking to some [documentation overview page](/sandbox/documentation)
