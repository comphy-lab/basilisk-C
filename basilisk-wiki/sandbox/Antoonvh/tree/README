# The aerodynamic drag of a tree

This folder contains pages that concern the aerodynamic modeling of leafless trees. This is part of a bigger research project named [Plantenna](https://www.4tu.nl/plantenna/en/).

## Simulations

* [Flow past a 2D cylindrical branch](cyl2d.c)
* [Flow past two 2D cylindrical branches](2cyl2d.c)
* [A rapidly growing tree](add_branches.c)
* [Flow past a 3D cylindrical branch](cyl3d.c)
* [Flow past a fractal tree](fractaltree.c)
* [Flow past a space-colonized tree](404)
* (some increasingly complex pages)  
* [Flow past realistic tree geometries](404)  

## Cell-fraction embedded-tree pages 
* [A Simple fractal](tree-test.c)  
* [A tree generated with space colonization](colonizedtree.c)  
* [A "real tree" from line-segment skeleton (via `QSMTREE`)](realtree.c)  
* [A "real tree" from a `.stl` file (via `Adtree`)](mekel.c)  

## Methods
