Here are 3 sets of custom colormaps functions for output_ppm procedure. They are autogenerated from datasheets. Data and scripts to generate them ar in the attachments to [this message](https://groups.google.com/g/basilisk-fr/c/rSVl8zNymZk) in the forum. 

[colorbrewer-diverging.h](colorbrewer-diverging.h) -  diverging (i. e with 2 different saturated colors at ends of scale and pale color at the middle of scale) colormaps from the site [colorbrewer2.org](http://colorbrewer2.org)

[colorbrewer-sequential.h](colorbrewer-sequential.h) - sequential (i.e. with pale color at the low end and saturated color at the high end of scale) colormaps from the site [colorbrewer2.org](http://colorbrewer2.org)

[moreland.h](moreland.h) - various (not all) "ergonomic" colormaps from the site [https://www.kennethmoreland.com/color-advice/](https://www.kennethmoreland.com/color-advice/)

I used cool_warm colormap function from output.h as the example.

I really tested only 2 of them: "blues"  and "reds", the rest are generated just in case.

Maybe these colormaps will be useful.
