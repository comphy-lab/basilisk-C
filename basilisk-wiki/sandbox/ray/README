#Oil lens on water
We want to use three phases in Basilisk for simulating an oil lens on water with air over.   
We want to reproduce the two cases of Chen Paper (Microfluid Nanofluid (2017) 21:109)    
with ratios on surface tensions water-air, oil-air, water-oil : 1.0 - 1.0 - 1.0 and 0.8 - 1.0 - 1.4  
and without gravity.

[case one Chen](/case_one_axi_sig_1_1_1.mpg)   
    
[case two Chen](/case_two_axi_sig_0.8_1_1.4.mpg)   

We want to check that there is no separation between phases at the triple point    
and visualize interfaces (lines air/white, water/red, oil/blue)

[triple point case one](http://bipbip.ida.upmc.fr/~ray/three_phases/mov_one_tripleline.mpg)   

[triple point case two](http://bipbip.ida.upmc.fr/~ray/three_phases/mov_two_tripleline.mpg)   

For doing that we need to use three fields f1,f2,f3 and modifying two-phase.h inside
Basilisk: [three-phase.h]()

We can now write our own program for oil lens which use three-phase.h: [oil_lens.c]()
