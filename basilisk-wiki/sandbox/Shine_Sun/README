Hello everyone!

I am Shine Sun, a PhD student from People's Republic of China. I use Basilisk to finish my PhD thesis and I have learnt a lot from the OpenSource software. Thank you Stephane Popinet, the Basilisk team and all from the community!   

I am interested in the gas-liquid flow and the atomization phenomena. I benefit a lot from the codes contributed by the community and I want to help others like me as much as I can. Therefore I create my sandbox and I hope my codes can inspire you. If you get help from the community, please do a better job and help others when they need help.
