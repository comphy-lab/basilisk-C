Here is a note about how to create/add new pages in my sandbox.  

* First, go to my README page and ```edit``` it.
* Second, add the new page at the bottom of the code script in the format  
`[Page Name](Page Path relative to the current file)`  
* Then we can click the link on the README page and edit the new page.  
* For the path format, see [basilisk_help](http://basilisk.fr/Help#wiki-links).
