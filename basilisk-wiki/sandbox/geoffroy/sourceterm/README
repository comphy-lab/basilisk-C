# Source term for Saint-Venant equations

The Saint-Venant equations, also known as shallow water equations, are
describing flow with much larger horizontal lenght-scale than the
vertical lenght-scale. These equations can be written as :

$$
\begin{array}{cc} \partial_t h + \partial_x q = S_h^i
\\ \partial_t q + \partial_x \left(\frac{q^2}{h}+ \frac{1}{2} g h^2
\right) = -gh S_0 + S_q^i \end{array} 
$$ 

where $S_h^i$ and $S_q^i$ are the different source terms.

For example, in $S_h^i$ we can put a rain source (or any mass source)
term and we usually put the friction in the term $S_q^i$ (or any
momentum source).

## The mass source terms

* [rain](rain.h)
* [infiltration]() (coming soon)

## The momentum source terms

* [Darcy friction](darcy.h)
* [Manning friction](manning.h)
* [Poiseuille friction](poiseuille.h)

## Note

These source terms are especially designed to be used with the
[predictor-corrector-source.h](http://basilisk.fr/sandbox/geoffroy/dev/predictor-corrector-source.h)
You can use it by downloading it and replacing it in "saint-venant.h"
