I store here all my libraries :

* [discharge.h](discharge.h) : a library designed to impose a total inflow on a river. 
This library is already included in basilisk. 
* [generic time-incrementator](gen-time-inc.h)  : a time-incrementator where you can chose the order. 
It's using a low-storage scheme.
* [predictor-corrector with source](predictor-corrector-source.h) : the predictor-corrector scheme which use the source terms defined [there](http://basilisk.fr/sandbox/geoffroy/sourceterm/README)
