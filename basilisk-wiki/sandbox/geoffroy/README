# Geoffroy Kirstetter sandbox

Hello, I'm Geoffroy Kirstetter and you're actually visiting my sand
box. I store in this location all the work I have done with
Basilisk. I usually work with the Saint-Venant equations but you can
also find more generic codes I developed in the [dev](dev/README)
repertory. My Sandbox is divided in different parts :

## Browser

* [dev](dev/README) : A collection of usefull libraries. It's here you'll
find the predictor-corrector to use the source terms.
* [friction](friction/README) : A set of benchmarks to test the friction 
and the rain in Saint-Venant.
* [test case](testcase/README) : Different test cases.
* [sourceterm](sourceterm/README) : A set of source terms.

## Cook book

* [My Cookbook](cookbook)

## Teaching
* [M2 Polytech'Nice Sophia](teaching/README)
