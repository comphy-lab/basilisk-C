## Friction test cases

Here we test the friction source term in the case of
fluvial/torrential flows for three differents source terms. The
original test case is the one of MacDonald[1] and you can find more
similar test cases in Delestre & al.[2]. The principle is to set the
topography in order to have an analytical solution for h(x). The
source term is treated semi-implicitly at the same order than the
Saint-Venant function, which is at order 2, except for the Darcy 1
order case.
 
### Case description

We consider a 1D topography $z_b(x)$ which is 1000 metres long. 
At steady state, the momentum equation of Saint-Venant can be written as :

$$
\partial_x z_b(x) = (\frac{q^2}{g h^3}-1) \partial_x h(x) - S_f \ ,
$$ 

where $S_f$ is the friction term. By chosing an analytical function $hex(x)$
for $h(x)$, we can find the resulting topography with a r-k method.


### Fluvial

For the sub-critical case, the analytical water height at steady state is :

$$
hex(x) = \left( \frac{4}{g} \right)^{1/3} \left( 1 + 0.5\times exp\left( -16\times (\frac{x}{1000}-0.5)^2 \right) \right).
$$   

The slope is initially dry ($h(x) = u(x) = 0$) and we chose as boundaries conditions :

$$
q[left] = 1.5 m^2 .s^{-1} \ and \ h[left] = hex(0) ,
$$

$$
q[right] = 1.5 m^2 .s^{-1} \ and \ h[right] = hex(1000).
$$

### Torrential 

For the super-critical case, the analytical water height at steady state is :

$$
hex(x) = \left( \frac{4}{g} \right)^{1/3} \left( 1 - 0.2\times exp\left( -36\times (\frac{x}{1000}-0.5)^2 \right) \right).
$$   

The slope is initially dry ($h(x) = u(x) = 0$) and we chose as boundaries conditions :

$$
q[left] = 2.5 m^2 .s^{-1} \ and \ h[left] = hex(0). 
$$

### Order treatment

We compare the convergence of $|h|_1$ for the different source treatment 
(order 1 and 2), for the torrential case with the darcy friction term :

Note that the convergence depends strongly on the chosen source term.

### Subcritical to super-critical

The flow is subcritical upstream and super-critical downstream. The water
height is :

$$
h_{ex}(x) = \left( \frac{4}{g} \right)^{1/3} \left( 1 - 3\times tanh\left( -3\times (\frac{x}{1000}-0.5)^2 \right) \right).
$$
for $0 < x < 500$ and :
$$
h_{ex}(x) = \left( \frac{4}{g} \right)^{1/6} \left( 1 - 6\times  tanh\left( -3\times (\frac{x}{1000}-0.5)^2 \right) \right).
$$
for $500 < x < 1000$.

## Rain test cases

We add a rain term to the MacDonald test case, as seen in Delestre et
al.[2]. Write R the constant rain intensity, the flux along the
channel is written : 

$$ 
q(x) = q0 + x*R. 
$$ 

So the topography is now : 

$$ 
\partial_x z_b(x) = (\frac{q(x)^2}{g h^3}-1) \partial_x h(x) -\frac{2q(x) R}{g h(x)^2}- S_f  
$$

We take the same function for hex(x) seen with the friction test cases in both torrential
and fluvial case and we use the Darcy friction term :
